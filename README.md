# Wells Fargo Job Simulation - Financial Advisor Client Management System

This project is part of the Wells Fargo Job Simulation on Forage, focused on implementing a Financial Advisor Client Management System.

## Project Overview

In this simulation, I have implemented classes for interaction with JPA within a Spring application, specifically for managing relationships between financial advisors and their clients. The project involves defining and implementing a data model that reflects the structure and relationships in a financial advisor client management system.

## Implementation Details

- **Entities Implemented:**
    - `Advisor`
    - `Client`
    - `Portfolio`
    - `Security`

Each entity is annotated with the `@Entity` annotation from the `javax.persistence` package, with auto-generated IDs, and appropriate relationships between entities are defined using JPA annotations.

## Development Process

1. Fork and clone the starter repository provided in the simulation.
2. Explore the codebase and understand the overall flow of the Spring application.
3. Implement the data model by creating classes for each entity in the `entities` directory.
4. Annotate each entity with the necessary JPA annotations and ensure that each class has a constructor, getters, and setters.
5. Commit and push the changes to GitHub.
